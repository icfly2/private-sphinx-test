Gas and power day
    In the natural gas trade in the UK, midnight occurs at 05:00 am. Thus gas
    purchased on the 29.2.2016 at 12:06 for operation of a gas engine on 1.3.2016
    at 03:30 - 04:30 would be priced at the within day market price of the 29.2 while
    gas for the same engine run on the 2.3 would, like gas for a run at 06:15
    be purchased at the day ahead rate. In power, midnight means midnight.

Day ahead market
    The market on which gas or power is sold and bought at least 24h before its use.
    This implies that the prices are fixed and any asset can easily participate,
    but more trading opportunities will arise at a later date.
    In the UK this is the N2EX market, in Germany the EEX.


Intra-day market (power)
    The power intra day market consists of a bidding process where binding bids are
    offered. The energy is traded in blocks, with the power and price of the block
    being offered. Accepting an offer, leads to the binding requirement to provide this
    energy (Which can be from the imbalance market). Gate closure for the blocks
    depends on the blocks, but occurs 1:10 - 1:30 before the start of the block.

Intra-day market (gas)
    On the gas market, gas can be bough and sold continuously. However, of the gas
    purchased in one day only 1/24 x hours since start of day, may be resold.


Imbalance
    The imbalance market is the last opportunity to trade energy. Any energy
    with a generating license participates in this market. Any energy over produced
    in a give period is reimbursed at the system imbalance price (SIP) any under
    production must by bought at the (SIP). SIP prices are only published hours
    after the fact, however there are forecasts, which vary in reliability.
